VU Homework Week 3 Password Generator Summary:
<h2>VU Bootcamp week 2 homework summary:</h2>
This application demostrates generating a random password with five primary criteria set by the user. The first prompt requires the user to choose a number between 8 and 128. The user is then directed to choose from upper case, lower case, a set of numbers from 0 to 9 and a series of characters. The users chooses the desired criteria with a series of confirm prompts. I used a series of if else statements to accomodate for all user input including a conditional alert for lack of user input. The function loops through the user input criteria and is displayed on the page. The comments in javascript file walk through all the neccessary pieces to explain the functionality.
